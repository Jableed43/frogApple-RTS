# My Incredible Apple Collection Game

Welcome to My Incredible Apple Collection Game! In this fun 2D game, you control an agile character on a mission to collect as many apples as possible before they disappear. But be careful, time is running out and some surprises await you!

## How to Play

### Controls

* **Left Arrow (←):** Move the character to the left.
* **Right Arrow (→):** Move the character to the right.

### Objective

The main objective is to reach a score of 100 by collecting apples.

### Rules

1.  **Collecting Apples:** Apples will appear randomly on the screen. Move close to them to collect them and earn 1 point for each one.
